How to contribute to Future Kids

Thanks for your interest on contributing to future_kids! Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs to future_kids that we ask you to take a look first.

Reporting Issues
Before reporting a new issue, please be sure that the issue wasn't already reported or fixed by searching on GitHub through our issues.

When creating a new issue, be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and either a test case example that replicates the issue - we need as much context and details as possible to identify what might be broken for you.

Avoid opening new issues to ask questions in our issues tracker. Please go through the project, documentation and source code first.


Sending Pull Requests

Before sending a new Pull Request, take a look on existing Pull Requests and Issues to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past, or if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new Pull Requests to include enough tests for new or changed behavior, and we aim to maintain everything as most backwards compatible as possible, reserving breaking changes to be ship in major releases when necessary.

If your Pull Request includes new or changed behavior, be sure that the changes are covering wide range of use cases.
